# EHN-Empowering-Health-Network

### Overview:

EHN (Empowering Health Network) is a project I developed with international teammates in Tokyo, Japan during a month-long Hacakthon style coding exercise. Our team was tasked with developing an application to help people navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore the purpose of EHN is to support mental health during COVID isolation by connecting and empowering people through relatable experiences. 

EHN is a blog style social media platform that is catered towards helping individuals navigate their Covid-19 isolation by allowing affected people to post, comment and learn about other experiences. Additionally, some people who suffer from COVID-19 develop a condition called Parosmia, where their taste and smell are altered. Therefore, we also created a Parosmia flavor rating tool (Foomy) that allows users to input and share what foods now taste different to help people affected by Parosmia connect and discover what foods they can and can't eat.

#### Personal Contributions 
As the Back-end Team leader I led Back-End discussions, assigned tasks and worked with the front-end team to collaboratively determine and implement the structure and features of the REST-ful API. The discussion topics included but were not limited to what API endpoints were to be implemented, security, QA testing and general questions that would help the team produce the best product. These discussions took place in both Japanese and English in order to make sure the team was communicating effectively. Additionally, I helped code and develop the REST-ful API.
